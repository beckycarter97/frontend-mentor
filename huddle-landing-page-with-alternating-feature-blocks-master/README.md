<h1>Huddle Landing Page with Alternating Feature Blocks</h1>
<h3>Becky Carter</h3>

Repository for working on the <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/">Frontend Mentor</a> challenge <a href="https://beta.frontendmentor.io/challenges/huddle-landing-page-with-alternating-feature-blocks-5ca5f5981e82137ec91a5100">Huddle landing page with alternating feature blocks</a>. I will be completing the challenge using only HTMl and CSS, and working on it as I practise these two skills.
